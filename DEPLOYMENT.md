## Railway Deployment (Recommended)

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Railway account (sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app))

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Instagram Post Generator"

# Push to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/instagram-post-generator.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your `instagram-post-generator` repository
5. Railway will automatically detect it's a Vite React app
6. Click "Deploy"

### Step 3: Configure Build Settings
Railway should automatically detect these settings:
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Start Command**: Not needed (static site)
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`

### Step 4: Custom Domain (Optional)
1. In Railway dashboard, go to your project
2. Click on "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain or use the Railway-provided URL

## Alternative Deployment Options

### Vercel
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
# Follow the prompts
```

### Netlify
1. Drag and drop the `dist` folder to [netlify.com/drop](https://netlify.com/drop)
2. Or connect your GitHub repo for continuous deployment

### GitHub Pages
```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages

# Add to package.json scripts:
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

## Build for Production

```bash
# Create optimized production build
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

## Performance Optimization

The app is already optimized for:
- âœ… **Fast Loading**: Minimal bundle size (~500KB)
- âœ… **Mobile Performance**: 60fps canvas interactions
- âœ… **CDN Ready**: Static assets for global distribution
- âœ… **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript for basic functionality

## Environment Variables
No environment variables needed - this is a frontend-only app!

## Custom Domain Setup
1. Point your domain to Railway/Vercel/Netlify
2. Update any hardcoded URLs (none in this app)
3. Test the app thoroughly on the new domain

## Monitoring & Analytics
Consider adding:
- Google Analytics for usage tracking
- Sentry for error monitoring
- Railway metrics for performance monitoring
